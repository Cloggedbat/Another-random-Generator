  This project is built to display project teams while only running Node.js. This was an interesting project working with tests, and basicaly reverse enginering from what I was able to understfrom the the tests. I was also cool to see how HTML was able to be pulled from externeal files and fit into segments of the main HTML page, then rendering into a new file that can be displayed shown below.
